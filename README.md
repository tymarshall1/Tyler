Hello, my name is Tyler Marshall.

I'm an inspiring software engineer who is building a portfolio here on github.
My repos pretty much document my current journey of learning web development.
I completed an associates degree in computer science in mid-2023. This is when I
started to really dive deep into web technologies in hopes of landing a frontend/fullstack career
within the next year.

Feel free to checkout any of my public repos and let me know what you think!
Most of them have live links in the README section so you can easily view the
project. Some of the notable ones are pinned on my profile.
