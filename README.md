I'm an aspiring software engineer currently building my portfolio on GitHub. My repositories essentially document my ongoing journey of learning web development. I completed an associate's degree in computer science in mid-2023, and it was during this time that I delved deep into web technologies with the goal of securing a frontend/fullstack career within the next year.

While in college, I engaged in some minimal work with the Django and Spring frameworks, although these projects were not uploaded to GitHub.

Feel free to check out any of my public repos and share your thoughts! Most of them include live links in the README section, allowing for easy project viewing. Some of the notable ones are pinned on my profile
